# TYPO3 Migration Framework

## Description

This extension (**EXT:migration**) is a helper extension for your TYPO3 updates and migrations based
on CLI commands (to prevent timeouts, use a better performance, etc...).

What can this extension do for you:
* [Migration](Documentation/Migration.md) of table values
* [Import](Documentation/Migration.md) tables values from other tables
* [Port: Export](Documentation/Port.md) of whole page branches with all records and files as json
* [Port: Import](Documentation/Port.md) of whole page branches with all records and files from json into an existing table (and gives new identifiers and relations)
* [Page actions](Documentation/Helper.md) (move, copy and delete) from CLI

This framework extension helped us (in2code) in some really large projects to migrate some stuff - e.g.:
* old backendlayouts to new backendlayouts
* tt_news to tx_news
* templatevoila to backendlayouts and gridelements
* mailform to powermail or mailform to form
* individual stuff to different individual stuff

**Note**:
This extension is not a ready-to-use extension for your (e.g.) tt_news to tx_news migration. 
In my eyes it's nearly not possible to build a one-solves-all migrator extension that automatically fits all needs of 
your installation.
Because TYPO3 instances can be build in such different ways an individual configuration is often needed.

**Note2**:
If you want to use this extension for your migrations, you need a basic understanding of the database structure
of your TYPO3 instance. Because you have to set up the migrators and importers by yourself
(e.g. you have to know that tt_news.title will be migrated to tx_news_domain_model_news.title for your news
migration, etc...).


Some naming conventions:
* **Import** means here: Import stuff from an old to a new table (like from tt_news to tx_news_domain_model_news)
* **Migrate** means here: Migrate existing records in an existing table (like in tt_content from TemplaVoila to Gridelements)




## Introduction

### Possible roadmap for TYPO3 update and migration projects

If your migration comes along with a TYPO3 update (like from 6.2 to 9.5 or so), you should go this way:

* Update
  * Start with an empty database and a new TYPO3 9.5 and build your functions in it with some testpages
  * Add additional functions that are needed to your small test instance (like news, powermail, own content elements, etc...)
  * Of course I would recommend to store the complete configuration (TypoScript, TSConfig etc...) in an extension (sitepackage)
* Preperation
  * Import your old database into the new instance
  * Make a db compare (I would recommend the package **typo3_console** for this to do this from CLI)
  * Make your update wizard steps (I would also recommend the package **typo3_console** for this to do this from CLI)
* Migration
  * Dump your new database
  * Add an extension (e.g. key `migration_extend`) with a composer.json and require `in2code/migration` in it
  * Install this extension (e.g. in require_dev section)
  * Start with adding your own Migrators and Importers to your extension (Add a configuration file to your extension)
  * And then have fun with migrating, rolling back database, update your scripts, migrate again, and so on
* Finish
  * If you are finished and have a good result, you simply can remove both extensions

## Example CLI commands

```
# Example migration
./vendor/bin/typo3 migration:migrate --configuration EXT:migration_extend/Configuration/Migration.php

# Example export into json file
./vendor/bin/typo3 migration:export 123 > /home/user/export.json

# Example import from json file
./vendor/bin/typo3 migration:import /home/user/export.json 123
```

See documenation for a detailed description of all CLI commands



## Documenation

* [Migration and Import](Documentation/Migration.md)
* [Port (Import and Export)](Documentation/Port.md) 
* [Helpers](Documentation/Helper.md) 



## Breaking changes

* Update to 7.6.0: This is only a small breaking change because constructors in extended with a configuration array now. If you are using own propertyHelpers and you overwrote __construct(), you have also to pass the new variable now.
